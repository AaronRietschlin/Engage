-Crash happened when registering.
	-Cause was the ProgressDialog error was: 
		Activity com.engage.ui.RegisterActivity has leaked window com.android.internal.policy.impl.PhoneWindow$DecorView@418b2d78 that was originally added here
		
-Add Username to parse. Use first and last name.

-Deal with parse not being initialized after returning to the application after leaving.
